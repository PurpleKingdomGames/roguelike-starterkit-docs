# Terminal UI

!["A colour palette made with the Terminal UI"](/img/color-palette.png)

### Getting started

The Roguelike Starterkit includes a UI system specifically for roguelikes / Terminal graphics. It is build directly on top of Indigo's UI system, but snaps everything to a terminal grid.

Please refer to the examples for usage.

#### Rendering / Graphics

Being part of the RLSK, under the covers, the Terminal UI is rendered using terminal emulators and character sheets.

To change the graphics of your UI, all you have to do is replace the appropriate characters on a sprite sheet, and feed it to the game / UI system.
