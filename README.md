# Roguelike Starter-kit Docs

This repository is meant to act as 'living documentation' for the Roguelike Starter-kit, an [Indigo](https://indigoengine.io/) extension that provides terminal-style rendering and tools for making traditional Roguelike's in Indigo.

## Building the examples and documentation

This documentation site is built using [purpledoc](https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/purpledoc).

With an alias to `purpledoc` setup, you can build everything by running `purpledoc -i .` in the root of this repo.

This will be slow the first time you run it, but once the modules have all been built and cached by Mill, it should be much faster.
