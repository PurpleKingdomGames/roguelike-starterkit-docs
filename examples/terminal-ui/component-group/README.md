# UI Components: Component Group

Component groups and component lists are containers for other components. The difference between the two is that a component group is a known collection of components that can be dynamically sized; while a component list is a dynamic collection of components with more limited layout options.

Using component groups and lists, component UI system provides out of the box functionality for standard requirements like re-flowing / responsively positioned UI elements. Indigo's UI system is _not_ as clever as using something like HTML, but should satisfy many common use cases.
