In this example, we look at how to set up a terminal version of a Window. If you compare this to the Indigo example, you'll notice that it involves much less code. This is because a lot of the set up and presentation has been abstracted away into a standard form. Of course, there is no reason you couldn't make your own version if you wanted a different look.
