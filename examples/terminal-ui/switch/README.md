# UI Components: Switch

This example shows how to set up a `Switch` using Indigo's general UI system.

A switch is a simple two state button, which can be off or on. On their own they act a lot like a checkbox, but they can also be used to create move complex components like radio button groups.

## A word on appearance

Indigo's UI component system is a generic UI layout system, and as such does not come with any specific rendering / look-and-feel helpers. In this example, the component's visuals will be constructed using simple primitives like shapes and text boxes, but the look and feel are only limited by what you can get Indigo to render.
