# UI Components: HitArea

This example shows how to set up a `HitArea` using Indigo's UI system.

Hit areas are slightly unusual components in that they are invisible (aside from a debugging option), and were originally designed to work with window anchors. Their purpose is to place a 'button' over part of a background image, effectively making it interactive.
